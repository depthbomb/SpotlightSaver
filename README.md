# Spotlight Saver

This app saves the beautiful Windows 10 spotlight wallpapers, seen on the lockscreen, to a folder located at `Pictures\Windows Spotlight`.

## Requirements

Requires _Windows 10 Anniversary Update_ (`1607`, `Redstone 1`, `10.0.14393`) or later. **Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager** (enabled by default) should also not be disabled or else you won't receive new images periodically.

## Usage

Spotlight Saver can either be downloaded as a standalone binary or installed via an installer, both of which are provided in the [latest release.](https://github.com/depthbomb/SpotlightSaver/releases/latest)

As a standalone binary, it can be [added to your system's PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/) and executed from anywhere.

Installing through the installer allows you to run Spotlight Saver automatically when you log in.
