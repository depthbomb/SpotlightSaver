# Spotlight Saver

This app saves the beautiful Windows 10 spotlight wallpapers (seen on lockscreen) to a folder located at `Pictures\Windows 10 Spotlight`.
## Download
Grab the latest release [here](https://github.com/depthbomb/SpotlightSaver/releases/latest), extract it, and run it.

## Running automatically
Running Spotlight Saver on startup is as simple as putting a shortcut to the .exe in `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

## Caveats
* If you've somehow disabled `Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager` then you will probably not get any new images and thus this app will not work very well
* This only works on Windows 10 (post-Anniversary update, 10.0.1607)
