# Spotlight Saver

This app saves the beautiful Windows 10 spotlight wallpapers (seen on lockscreen) to a folder located at `Pictures\Windows Spotlight`.

## Download

Download and run the latest installer from [here](https://github.com/depthbomb/SpotlightSaver/releases/latest).

## Running automatically

Simply check the **Run on startup** option when installing and SpotlightSaver will automatically run when you log in!

## Caveats

* If you've somehow disabled `Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager` then you will probably not get any new images and thus this app will not work very well
* This only works on Windows 10 (post-Anniversary update, 10.0.1607)
